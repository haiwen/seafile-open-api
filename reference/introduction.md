The Seafile API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

 Seafile is a self-hosted cloud storage system. We don't provide a cloud service. You need to test the APIs with your own account in your own Seafile instance.
